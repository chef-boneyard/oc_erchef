% Couple of notes:
% 1. Order by type is to ensure that our most likely case - a client key - comes up for
%    checking first. In the future we may wish to add additional heuristics
%    to increase the likelihood of matching early.
% 2. expires_at is 'timestamp without timezone', which means storage as UTC.  We force
%    current_timestamp to UTC to ensure a valid comparison.
