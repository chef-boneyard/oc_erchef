oc_erchef - Opscode PRIVATE Chef API
====================================

lol travis

This is the top-level project for the Erlang implementation of OPC's
REST API. It corresponds to the `erchef` project in OSC but includes
additional support for multitenancy and role based access controls
(authz).

This project exists to build the `oc_erchef` OTP release system and
manage the complete list of dependencies that constitute an
`oc_erchef` release.

Release tagging and branching
-----------------------------

All dependencies are locked via `rebar.config.lock`. We update the
lock file on master and tag releases off of master.

You can update the lock file (pull in latest versions of dependencies)
as follows:

1. Decide if this should be a _patch_, _minor_, or _major_ version
   bump for oc_erchef.

2. Prepare a new release. This removes all local deps, pulls new deps
   **not using the lock file**, updates the lock file, compiles, and
   builds the OTP release, and increments the release version in
   `rel/reltool.config` based on the value of the `BUMP` environment
   variable. For example, to prepare a minor release:
   ```
   BUMP=minor make prepare_release && rebar commit-release
   ```
3. Review the commit log produced via `rebar commit-release`. It will
   show you which dependencies were added, removed, or changed. For
   changed deps, it will summarize the changes.

Note that you can perform the above steps on a feature branch of this
repo and push that through CI for testing or pull it into an
opscode-omnibus build locally (you will need to push your feature
branch).
